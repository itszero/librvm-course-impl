Q1. How to compile?
Ans: Type make and the make file will compile the library. 
     There are two header files, rvm.h and log.h
     You should only need to include rvm.h to use the library.
     The source code for rvm.h is in librvm.c.
     The source code for log.h is in log.c, which contains all the functions related to log file access. 
    

Q2. Log file structures?
Ans: The log file subsystem creates a seperate log file for each directory-segment pair.
     It stores the offset for the segment, the size of the segment, and the updated value.
     If the log segement was not successfully updated, it will restore back to its previous state when loading the log file. 
     The checking of a successful logging is by comparing the size of the data.
     To clean up the log file, we perform a truncate_log after the log file exceeds some threshold.
